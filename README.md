# B-Tree of Order 4 (Key-Value Storage)

A modular C implementation of a **B-Tree of order 4**, where each node can store up to **4 keys** and **5 children**.  
Each key is an `int`, and each value is a `string`.  

This project supports:
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Search
- Level-order traversal (grouped by level)
- Modular file structure
- Build system via `Makefile`

## Compilation

Use **MSYS2 UCRT64 shell** (or any POSIX-compatible Bash with working `gcc` and `make`):

To run the program:
./btree_app

## Sample Output

Search result for 20: Rahul

Search result for 100: Not Found

Level-order traversal:

[10,Pratham]

[2,Hardik 3,Burhan 5,Ridin] [12,Yash 17,Divyansh 20,Rahul 30,Shivam]

# Btree details

Order: 4 (i.e., max 4 keys, max 5 children)

Key: Integer

Value: String

Balanced: Always remains height-balanced due to node splitting/merging.
